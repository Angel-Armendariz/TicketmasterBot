# TicketMaster Bot

Note: This bot is designed to only work with Ticketmasters new website. (i.e. url starts with www1.ticketmaster)
It will attempt to add the default number of lowest price tickets to the cart.
You can change the number of tickets by modifying the numberOfTickets variable in the script. (Instructions to follow)

If this Bot successfully secures you tickets please donate. (no matter how small)
The more donations the more I will maintain the code and ensure it keeps working for future use!
