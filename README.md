# TicketMaster Bot

Note: This bot is designed to only work with Ticketmasters new website. (i.e. url starts with www1.ticketmaster)
It will attempt to add the default number of lowest price tickets to the cart.
You can change the number of tickets by modifying the numberOfTickets variable in the script. (Instructions to follow)

3. Navigate to a www1.ticketmaster ticket page shortly before the tickets are due to go on sale.


Tip: Test it out on a page were tickets are already on sale.
Tip: You can rub multiple tabs to increase your chances (But be careful!!!, too many requests and you rsik getting your ip blocked)


If this Bot successfully secures you tickets please donate. (no matter how small)
The more donations the more I will maintain the code and ensure it keeps working for future use!
